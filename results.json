I asked if the pt/account she was trying to create was a common first or last name, Leslie states it's not\r\nI sent her the IRIS triage questions to escalate this to the IRIS Team\r\n\r\nSummary of the issue:\r\nError(s): \r\nWhat is the business impact due to this issue?: I can't work efficiently. I have to close or force IRIS to restart while I have the member on the line. Sometimes the member doesn't' want to wait & I can't review all the alerts on their account because they are not populating & the member can't wait. Which causes my FCR/metrics to be lower.\r\n \r\nDetailed steps of the issue (Include screenshots, what you are doing in IRIS at the time of the issue, and what responsibility you are using.): IRIS freezes in simple tasks. For example, when I am switching tabs it freezes, if I'm putting the medications on auto refill it freezes. When I click the alerts tab to see dashboard no info is populated, I can't add a phone # the box stays grey, the screen turning black randomly & I have to force IRIS to shut down. Other times I can't create accounts & the names of the members are not common ones- it closes by itself & I have to start all over again.\r\n \r\nWhat is supposed to happen if it was working correctly?: Nothing is supposed to be freeze as often & screens are not supposed to turn black.\r\n \r\nWorkaround (include screenshots): I can provide them when IRIS contacts me\r\n \r\nApprox start time of issue: It's random\r\n \r\nAny other details you feel may be helpful in finding a resolution: Several techs have re-installed IRIS & Genesys but I don't see that has helped. I clear cache/ java when I have problems but I can have the same problem on the next account.",
