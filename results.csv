Not allowing me to create accnts  See attached screenshots that Leslie provided I closed softphone, latest java is installed along with java settings for IRIS, 421 Reset edge to default, cleared java cache, confirmed all java TLS settings are set EU states she already cleared her cache herself and the issue continues. I did see in Leslie's ticket history that previously a similar issue was occurring due to the pt having a common first or last name. I asked if the pt/account she was trying to create was a common first or last name, Leslie states it's not I sent her the IRIS triage questions to escalate this to the IRIS Team  Summary of the issue: Error(s):  What is the business impact due to this issue?: I can't work efficiently. I have to close or force IRIS to restart while I have the member on the line. Sometimes the member doesn't' want to wait & I can't review all the alerts on their account because they are not populating & the member can't wait. Which causes my FCR/metrics to be lower.   Detailed steps of the issue (Include screenshots, what you are doing in IRIS at the time of the issue, and what responsibility you are using.): IRIS freezes in simple tasks. For example, when I am switching tabs it freezes, if I'm putting the medications on auto refill it freezes. When I click the alerts tab to see dashboard no info is populated, I can't add a phone # the box stays grey, the screen turning black randomly & I have to force IRIS to shut down. Other times I can't create accounts & the names of the members are not common ones- it closes by itself & I have to start all over again.   What is supposed to happen if it was working correctly?: Nothing is supposed to be freeze as often & screens are not supposed to turn black.   Workaround (include screenshots): I can provide them when IRIS contacts me   Approx start time of issue: It's random   Any other details you feel may be helpful in finding a resolution: Several techs have re-installed IRIS & Genesys but I don't see that has helped. I clear cache/ java when I have problems but I can have the same problem on the next account.","","Latency"
